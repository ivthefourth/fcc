## About
Allows you to search for articles on Wikipedia and displays a list of results (if any) on the current page. Clicking a result will take you to the Wikipedia page for that article. 

You can start a new search or you can load more results by clicking a button. You can also go to a random article by clicking a (poorly) hidden link. **Hint:** Follow the rainbow.
